description: Located off the west coast of Ireland, the Aran Islands were considered
  the country's pure, uncorrupted heart, the repository of its ancient language, culture,
  and spiritual values. John Millington Synge visited the Aran Islands during the
  years 1898 to 1901, gathering folklore and anecdotes that he would later use in
  his plays. His evocative travelogue is a peek at a disappearing way of life, capturing
  the ancient ways of the island, its breathtaking loveliness, and the charms of the
  residents and their customs.
